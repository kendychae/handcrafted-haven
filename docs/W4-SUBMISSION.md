### Challenge

Balancing feature development scope with project timeline while maintaining code quality. We encountered complexity in implementing advanced filtering functionality that required significant refactoring of the product display components to ensure proper state management and performance optimization.

### Success

Successfully enhanced the marketplace with improved product filtering, responsive mobile design, and dynamic artisan profiles. The team delivered a more polished user experience with better navigation, enhanced visual design, and improved accessibility features that exceed the original W3 functionality.

### Insight

We learned that iterative development with frequent team communication leads to better feature integration and fewer technical debt issues. Regular code reviews and collaborative problem-solving sessions have improved our development velocity and helped us identify potential issues early in the development process.
