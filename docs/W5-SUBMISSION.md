### Challenge

Managing image quality and consistency across the product catalog while ensuring appropriate content standards. We encountered significant complexity with external image sources requiring multiple iterations to find suitable product imagery that accurately represented each item while maintaining professional standards and fast load times.

### Success

Successfully resolved critical production deployment issues including build optimization, metadata compliance for Next.js 15, and comprehensive image correction for multiple product categories. The team delivered improved data consistency between product listings and detail pages, enhanced the Guatemalan textile product offering, and ensured all product images meet professional quality standards.

### Insight

We learned the importance of thorough image validation and content review before deployment to production environments. The iterative debugging process reinforced the value of systematic testing at each stage and maintaining clear communication about content requirements. Implementing proper separation between data sources and display components improved maintainability and reduced duplication errors across the application.
