## 3. Meeting Summary

### Participants

- Kendahl Bingham (Team Lead)
- Dominic Odeh Abah
- Nsisong Gabriel Johnson
- Manuel Mario Zamalloa Llantoy

### Challenge

Setting up proper GitHub collaboration workflow with branch protection rules while ensuring team members can contribute effectively. We had to balance security with accessibility, configuring branch protection to require pull requests while allowing the team lead to merge critical updates.

### Success

Successfully created a complete, functional marketplace application that exceeds the W3 requirements. Our Handcrafted Haven platform includes comprehensive Next.js application with TypeScript, responsive design with custom Tailwind CSS theming, complete product catalog with filtering functionality, dynamic artisan profile pages, and professional deployment on Vercel.

### Insight

We learned that effective project management requires both technical setup (proper Git workflow, project boards) and clear communication channels. Setting up comprehensive documentation and project boards upfront saves significant time during development and helps team members understand their roles and responsibilities.
